Added checks for all calls to malloc in src/data.c, and corresponding error
messages in the GUI and command line programs.
Using MinGW instead of Cygwin to create the installer for Windows.
Using productbuild instead of productbuild to create the installer for Mac.
Removed the mean and median functions from Pycluster, as anyway these are
available from Numerical Python. This also avoids problems with deprecated
API usage.
Added checks for calls to malloc in Algorithm::Cluster.
